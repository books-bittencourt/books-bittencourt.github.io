			And this is why: Unlike Richard Dawkings, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and many other famous atheists, who have never been religious, Paulo Bittencourt was raised Evangelical, studied Theology (nearly becoming a pastor) and, therefore, speaks from experience.

			“Excellent work! Paulo shares his intimate experience with hyperreligious indoctrination from child on and how to break free! On the way, he uses sometimes humor, sometimes radical messages, to make the reader understand God is an invisible fantasy to make your life, or the life of others, irrational and a misery. So, everyone who is still religious despite modern science, please read this book!”<span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span>

			“Definitely worth reading! This is definitely one of the best books I’ve ever read! Honestly: you will have to believe me, when I say this! There’s a lot of wisdom there, great insights, the author has a wonderful way with words and a delightful sense of humour, even while handling a subject as morose as religion often is.”<span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span>

			“I really like this book! To make his points, the author sometimes uses humor, sometimes straight forward reasoning. This book should be read by every religious person, especially the monotheistic ones.”<span class="quote-author">— Review on Google Play Books</span>

			“Paulo Bittencourt challenges religious belief, with a focus on Christianity. He champions freethinking, asking that believers step back from what they unquestioningly accept and think for themselves. He defines a freethinker as ‘someone who, in the search for truth, does not trust revelation, tradition and authority, but evidence, logic and reason’. The book is clearly written, in a lively style, and raises many serious questions about religion and the nature of religious faith.”<span class="quote-author">— Review on Amazon</span>
